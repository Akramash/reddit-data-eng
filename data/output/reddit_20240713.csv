TGIF fellow bright minded data engineers!

For those of you who’ve built or maintained a data lake/lakehouse for your company, what method & tools have you found works best for streamlined data access and transformation that seamlessly handles structured, semi-structured and unstructured data?

I’ve narrowed my search to 4 solutions;
- MS Fabric (since we already use MS tools) + open source tools where fabric can’t cover.
- Snowflake + Terraform
- Apache Iceberg + spark etc on S3
- Building custom APIs

Seems I’ll be the only one to implement this maybe with the help of my manager. So what solution do you recommend whether listed above or not that would not only be efficient enough to handle lots of big data in an enterprise but also be feasible for me to build as the main developer? My development skills aren’t that great either this has been a learning curve for me cos I’m a systems analyst.

1e1a4h5,The feature store is a specialized data warehouse that make temporal dat modelling easy,"
Hi. I am the organizer of the feature store conference and CEO of Hopsworks and frequently hear - i have a data warehouse, dont need a feature store.

In data engineering terms, the feature store provides guard rails that enable data scientists to do dimension modeling (facts are labels/targets, dimensions arw features) in Python, and create point in time consistent training data from a mix of type 0 and type 2 SCD tables using ASOF LEFT JOINs (using easy Python API calls). Then, there is also the real-time APIs in a feature store, but they are not important if you only build batch AI systems.

1e1vloz,Career crossroads. Looking for advice. Long post.,"Currently I'm 37 and 2.5 years into my first tech job since changing careers. I was pretty lucky to jump straight from a boot camp into somewhat of a junior DE role. 

I've got loads of experience here and frequently work with PO's, PM's and principal engineers on the planing side of things, on the code side working on my own for 12 months now with data pipelines and with most of the basic tools. Spark, python, SQL, AWS ect ect. 

Right now I have three options. 

1. Continue in my role. 

Things are getting more and BAU and monotonous, I'm spending 80% of my time band aiding edge cases in data and 20% of my time learning and creating new tooling. Salary will keep climbing and I'm happy with it for my X years of experience. Work might dry up depending where the new parent company wants to go. The better the work I do, the more I'm making my own role redundant.



2. Move to a product team as a SE.

Pick up a new stack (js/ruby/react/rails) and salary will increae the same as option 1 for at least a year or two. Mix of back and front end. I will get a card to work on, and see if to completion before getting another one. Will still be SME on my old stuff and have to be called on as a consultant now and then for decisions and guiding our overseas employees.



3. Find a new company to work for.

I've looked over the last few months, had a few interviews with zero ambition to get them. I could get paid more being a strict python dev working remotely, but it is the most boring option and I value working with people and excel in that regard. 

-------- So,

I've been asked to take up option two if I so desire, or stay in option one. Option three will always exist. My lazy brain is telling me to stay put as it's the easiest and more comfortable. 

Option two will bring me the most benefit as there aren't many DE's with no SE background, which I'm lacking - and I will always have that DE experience under my belt. 

The things playing on my mind are - we've been bought out by a big bad parent company now for 2 years, with redundancies each EOFY as they trim the fat before presumably passing us on when the investment cycle is up. 

Current role is probably the most well protected single employee in the company, nobody really knows how to operate the black boxes I've created and the risk adverse part of my brain has created minimal documentation since the first round of redundancies hit 12 months ago. 

I'm weary of continuing to know a little bit about a lot things, but no deep knowledge of a particular skill. Or reducing my possible salary range in the next few years, as I'm not getting any younger. 

The window to option two is closing soon. And I think it's my best foot foward. Any experice or advice welcome, change is scary and the path I've been on so far has been a dream come true. As for end game goals, just like every other idiot of course want to be a CTO or CEO one day.

1e1fgrz,Keeping it no longer than 9-6 as data engineer / devops,"Given these two fields involve large amounts of time spent on either data processing or infrastructure deployment (but specially data processing), I often find myself with empty spaces of work during the day which I use to learn new stuff or optimize what we already have, but other than that, it's all about waiting. Then, because we need to take advantage of processing time during the night or weekends, I find myself logging in at night or during the weekends just to check data processes finished, then I run more processes. I know data processing should be fully automated, but we are at the stage of a data migration project where we do both massive data load from the past + ETL automation of current, daily data. So how do you manage this kind of work? I find it hard to switch off, but given the amount of hours I work daily are low, I feel the responsibility to spend some hours at night or weekends to compensate the empty work hours during the day. My colleagues do so. We don't work for a startup nor a consultancy, it is a large corporation (a bank) which I mainly joined because of the work-life balance it was supposed to offer. But I guess that doesn't apply to data engineering or devops. am I missing something?

1e18bfa," Considering Converting Snowflake Native Tables to Snowflake-Managed Iceberg on S3 - Cost and Capability Concerns

","Hi everyone,

We currently use Snowflake and have several Snowflake native tables. For certain business processes, we snapshot these tables daily, and their size has been growing significantly. We now have 10 to 20 tables, each around 40TB in size.

With the recent release of Snowflake's support for Iceberg tables, I'm considering converting these tables to Snowflake-managed Iceberg tables and using S3 for storage. I'm trying to determine if this change will decrease our costs and how much savings we can expect. Additionally, I want to ensure that we don't lose any of Snowflake's capabilities like time travel, failsafe, etc.

Has anyone here made a similar transition? What was your experience regarding cost savings and feature retention and any issues with iceberg table? Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated!

1e1l3g2,Airflow Architecture recommendation: 1 large cluster or multiple small ones,"Hello Everyone. Wanted to elicit recommendations/suggestion on how to scale Airflow. 


Current setup: More than 200 Airflow instances (on-prem Kubernetes containers), persistent Postgres DB on VMs, DAGs stored on S3 compliant storage(on-prem). Basically every team/data scientist has their own instance. Some users are running small batch jobs within Airflow, for any larger jobs we are pushing them to move the processing to external containers and use Airflow only for orchestration as intended. 


Current problems: upgrades/patching is more complex, capacity utilization not efficient, monitoring and support is also more effort intensive.


We are evaluating moving to a common large cluster instead of this distributed approach. Wanted to hear more from people here of potential pitfalls/issues or benefits of the move. 

Some things I can think of:
While resource utilization will be more efficient, making sure we are setting up resource/capacity bounderies for users/teams to not step on each others' toes in a shared infra will be a challenge. 

Everyone will need to use a common version of dependencies (I am not sure if we can have multiple versions of libs in same Airflow cluster).
